# odin-rockpaperscissors

A rock paper scissors app that I created for the Project:Rock Paper Scissors on https://www.theodinproject.com/

## How It's Made:

I made this project to test my knowledge after learning some very basic operators in JavaScript. I had also learned about variables and functions.

**Tech used:** JavaScript

## Optimizations

Now that I have learned arrays and loops, I would use arrays and loops to solve this problem instead. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a great deal about function syntax and scope. One of the major roadblocks was scope issues related to the variable computerPlay. I initially had declared that in the global scope, but it needed to be declared in the function playSingleRound instead. Many of the lessons I learned throughout this project were lessons of that type, as I am very much still getting the feel of JavaScript logic.
