## How It's Made:

I made this project to test my knowledge after learning some very basic operators in JavaScript. I had also learned about variables and functions.

I then re-visted it after I had learned about how to modify the DOM with Javascript.

**Tech used:** JavaScript

## Optimizations

Looking at other peoples' solutions on the Odin Project website, I may have included a clearer visual cue for what the computer plays each turn. The flavor text is pretty small and easy to miss. Otherwise, I am pretty happy with how this came out.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a great deal about function syntax and scope. One of the major roadblocks was scope issues related to the variable computerPlay. I initially had declared that in the global scope, but it needed to be declared in the function playSingleRound instead. Many of the lessons I learned throughout this project were lessons of that type, as I am very much still getting the feel of JavaScript logic.
